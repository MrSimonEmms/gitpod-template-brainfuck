## Why?

As a language, brainfuck is one of those languages that we've all heard of but have never used. As an esoteric language, it's
not an easy language to get installed on your system and this is where [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) really shows its' power - all
you need is a Docker image and you've got a development environment that you can use.
